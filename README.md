# Canvas-Style Learning Management System

## We built a Canvas-style Learning Management System (LMS) with a modern, scalable stack:

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
	â€¢	Backend: FastAPI with OAuth2 authentication (secure login & session management)
	â€¢	Frontend: React (clean UI for students and instructors)
	â€¢	Deployment: AWS Elastic Beanstalk with autoscaling support
	â€¢	Other Features: Markdown support for course content and assignments

âœ¨ Features
	â€¢	Secure OAuth2 login for users
	â€¢	Instructor dashboards for course and assignment management
	â€¢	Student view for submissions, grades, and discussions
	â€¢	Markdown-based content creation and rendering
	â€¢	Autoscaling setup on AWS to handle variable traffic loads

## Why it matters

This project demonstrates how to combine FastAPI, React, and AWS to create a production-ready LMS thatâ€™s both scalable and user-friendly. Itâ€™s lightweight, easy to extend, and a solid base for education platforms.
